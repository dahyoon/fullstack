      US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the
      American team wanted to discuss a "framework" for peace to try to end the
      Russia-Ukraine war. Last Friday, Zelensky and Trump were involved in a
      public clash at the White House - during which Trump said Zelensky was not
      ready to end the fighting. The US proceeded to pause military aid to
      Ukraine and stop sharing intelligence. The Ukrainian president has
      expressed regret about the incident and tried to repair relations with the
      US - the country's biggest military supplier. On Thursday, Witkoff said
      Trump had received a letter from Zelensky that included an "apology" and
      "sense of gratitude". "Hopefully, we get things back on track with the
      Ukrainians, and everything resumes," Witkoff said. Zelensky has been under
      strong US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, while the
      Ukrainian president has been pushing for firm security guarantees for
      Kyiv.

      Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and now
      controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. The fighting continues, with
      Ukraine on Thursday night reporting a "massive missile and drone" attack
      on its energy infrastructure. The Polish military also said it was forced
      to scramble fighter jets and activate ground-based air defence systems
      amid the attack, which threatened regions as far as western Ukraine.

      Zelensky announced the US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia in a series of
      posts on social media, after attending Thursday's crisis summit in
      Brussels where European Union leaders endorsed plans for a boost in
      defence spending. "Ukrainian and American teams have resumed work, and we
      hope that next week we will have a meaningful meeting," he wrote on X.
      "Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first moment of the war,
      and we have always stated that the war continues solely because of
      Russia." Zelensky urged the global community to put more pressure on
      Moscow so it "accepts the need to end" the war. He also made an apparent
      reference to a truce plan outlined earlier this week by French President
      Emmanuel Macron, which proposed a ceasefire in the air and at sea, and an
      end to attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure. Russia has not
      publicly commented on the French proposals. On Thursday, Putin said Moscow
      was seeking a peace "that would ensure calmness for our country in the
      long-term perspective. "We don't need anything that belongs to others, but
      we won't give up anything that belongs to us either," the Kremlin leader
      added. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said he hopes a "fair, lasting,
      binding peace agreement that every side can accept" could be struck.
      Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014, and claims
      another four Ukrainian regions in the south-east as its own - although
      Moscow doesn't fully control them. Ukraine and its European allies have in
      recent weeks expressed alarm over what many on the continent see as Donald
      Trump's overtures to Russia. Trump vowed during the US election campaign
      to bring the war to an end quickly, and preliminary US-Russian talks were
      held in Saudi Arabia last month - without European or Ukrainian
      representatives present. The US's decision to halt its military aid
      Ukraine has been cast by Trump administration officials as a means of
      getting Kyiv to co-operate with the US-led peace talks. Any corresponding
      pressure the US has been putting on Moscow to make concessions has not
      been made public.

      So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right. As president of France in the
      1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.
      Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But
      the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with
      ours. In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more
      clairvoyant. From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle
      conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent – whose
      existence is now at the centre of debates over European security. France
      and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have
      nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads,
      which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines. The UK
      has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign
      – i.e. developed entirely by France – whereas the UK relies on US
      technical input. On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea
      that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could – in this highly
      uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European
      countries. His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right
      and left, who say that France is considering "sharing" its nuclear
      arsenal. That – according to government officials as well as defence
      experts – is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be "shared".
      According to Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent "is
      French and will remain French – from its conception to its production to
      its operation, under a decision of the president." What is under
      discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether
      France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other
      European countries. Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built
      around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought
      the "vital interests" of France were at stake.
